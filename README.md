# Ledstrip_ESP8266
A simple project that allows for the control of a RGB (4-pin) LED Strip to be controlled natively by Apples Homekit

# Notes:
- You'll need to download/have the ardunio IDE
- You'll need some sort of esp8266 or esp32 board (with at least 3 outputs)

This code is still a work in progress, as many other lighting solutions exsit for homekit and use much smarter lights like the neopixels ect (whcih have a single control wire)




# A couple of prerequisites:
- You'll need the ardunio homekit library
- You'll need the wifi library
